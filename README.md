# Connected Vineyard

**Connected Vineyard** is an IoT project developed for the Museum of Vine and Wine in Boudry.  
It was built **from scratch** using Raspberry Pi Zero, including both hardware assembly and software implementation.  

The system collects environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) from the vineyard and displays it in **real time** through a modern monitoring interface.
